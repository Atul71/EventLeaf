# Project Name - EventLeaf

# Project Description

EventLeaf is a full-stack eco-focused event management platform designed to reduce the environmental impact of organizing and attending events. Traditional event planning often relies on paper-based workflows, inefficient logistics, and limited visibility into sustainability practices. EventLeaf addresses these challenges by digitizing end-to-end event operations while enabling organizers to design, label, and promote eco-friendly events.

For organizers, EventLeaf simplifies the creation and management of sustainable events through fully digital workflows for event setup, ticketing, and attendance tracking. While creating an event, organizers can opt in to mark their event as eco-friendly by selecting sustainability-focused attributes such as paperless ticketing, digital check-ins, waste reduction practices, or environmentally responsible venue choices. These selections allow organizers to communicate their sustainability efforts clearly to attendees. Real-time ticket sales, revenue analytics, and QR-code–based check-ins further reduce paper usage while providing actionable insights into event performance.

For attendees, EventLeaf enables eco-conscious event discovery and participation through a seamless digital experience. Users can browse and search for events, filter or prioritize eco-friendly events, receive personalized recommendations based on interests, and purchase tickets online with digital confirmations instead of printed passes. Events can be added directly to personal calendars such as Google Calendar, promoting a fully paperless event journey.

By allowing organizers to explicitly classify and manage eco-friendly events and enabling attendees to discover and support them, EventLeaf encourages sustainable event practices while delivering a modern, efficient experience for all users.
